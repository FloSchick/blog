    Title: "ðŸ‘‹ Hi, IÂ´m Flo"
    Content: >
      Iâ€™m a **Platform Engineer** at a small **Bavarian** company.


      This blog is my space to share what I **learn** while building and running **infrastructure**.


      Youâ€™ll find posts about **Kubernetes**, **observability**, and **automating** the boring stuff.


      **Writing helps me think** and maybe some of it helps you too.
